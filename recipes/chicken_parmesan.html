        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic 
                (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. 
                Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 
                thickness of 1/2-inch.</li>
            <li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter 
                or strainer, sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly 
                coating both sides</li>
            <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside. Mix bread crumbs and 
                1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside. Dip a 
                flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast 
                to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. 
                Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat 1/2 inch of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high 
                heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in batches, so you 
                do not overcrowd the pan, until golden, about 2 minutes per side. 
                The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 
                tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal 
                amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. 
                Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 
                teaspoon olive oil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and 
                chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. 
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 
                at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Let chicken rest briefly before 
                serving.Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly
